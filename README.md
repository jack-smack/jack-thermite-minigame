# Usage

    exports["jack-thermite-minigame"]:thermitematch3({
	    time=60,
	    scoreTarget  =  2500
    }, function (sucess)
	    cb(sucess)
    end)
This is used on the client side.

## How does it work

The resource uses plain HTML/CSS/JS to create a lightweight new minigame for thermite. Its difficulty can be tweaked by requiring a higher score or constraining the time.

Score is built by matching 3 of Periodic elements on the board.
